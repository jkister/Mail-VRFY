Mail::VRFY version 1.01
=======================

Mail::VRFY was derived from Pete Fritchman's Mail::Verify.
Lots of code has been plucked.  This package attempts to be
completely compatibile with Mail::Verify.

Mail::VRFY provides a CheckAddress function for verifying email
addresses.  Lots can be checked, according to the method option,
as described below.

Mail::VRFY differs from Mail::Verify in that:
A.  More granular control over what kind of checks to run
    (via the method option).

B.  Email address syntax checking is much more stringent,
    and does not conform to RFC2822, however, will work
    fine on email addresses as we usually think of them.

C.  After making a socket to an authoritative SMTP server,
    we can start a SMTP converstation, to ensure the
    mailserver does not give a failure on RCPT TO.

D.  More return codes.
